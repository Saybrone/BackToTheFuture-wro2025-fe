        This repository details team <em>Back To The Future</em>'s building and programming process in the 2025 WRO Future Engineers Competition. 
      We are team <em> Back To The Future</em>, two students who are passionate about technology and robotics. For this competition we built an autonomous vehicle. We worked after school and on weekends. Through this competition, we learned how to work as a team and solve problems related to robotics.

## The Challenge <a class="anchor" id="challenge"></a>

In the **[WRO 2025 Future Engineers – Self-Driving Cars](https://wro-association.org/)** category, teams are tasked with creating a robotic vehicle that can autonomously navigate a changing racetrack. Each round introduces new track layouts, requiring vehicles to adapt in real time.
The competition highlights the full engineering process:

- **Vehicle Design**: Building a functional robot with electromechanical components and advanced steering or motion systems.
- **Obstacle Management**: Applying computer vision, sensor fusion, and motion planning to make real-time decisions.
- **Project Documentation**: Maintaining an engineering journal and sharing designs in a public GitHub repository.

Teams are judged on performance, innovation, reliability, and the clarity of their engineering process, encouraging creativity, teamwork, and STEM skills.
